## Lazy
[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is a plugin manager for neovim, with a focus on performance and ease of use via the UI.
## Telescope
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is a fuzzy finder for neovim, which I have used for live grep and file finding. It is highly customisable, but aslo great for improving the traversing projects in neovim.
## Nvim Treesitter
[Nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) is the neovim implementation of [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), a language parser used to generate syntax trees. What this really means is improved syntax highlighting, indentation etc.
## Catppuccin
[Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim). Nice theme, enough said.
## Lualine
[Lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) is a nice way to provide an overview of your editor status, including vim mode, git branch, and cursor location. OceanicNext is my choice, matching catppuccin well.
## Mason
[Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) is a package manager for LSP servers, linters and formatters. Provides a nice UI to manage tools, with support for the vast majority of languages. I currently have this setup to provide function description with `K`, defintions with `gd`, and `space+ca` for code actions. 
## None-ls
[None-ls](https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim) is the community support package for null-ls. I am using this to provide formatting and diagnostics.
## Gitsigns
[Git-signs](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) is a nifty tool, providing quick git information within your editor. I use it for line blames, hunk previews, and line change highlighting.
## Vim fugitive
[Vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) provides full CLI git functionality within the neovim command line. Just remember its a G.
